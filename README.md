About
-----
**The Absent Admin** is a base project to build your Drupal projects on top of using Travis CI to handle CI bash scripting and [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush) makefiles to download and build a project, as well as providing scripts to compile any [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) projects.
